**Week 1 @ Makers Academy**

# Introduction to Object Oriented Programming and Ruby


## The Project

Designing a very simple clone of London's Boris Bikes program.

### Classes
* **Bike**: Can be broken and fixed.
* **Docking Station**: Releases working bike to user, accepts returned bike from user, prevents user from releasing broken bike, releases broken bike to van, accepts fixed bike from van, and has a limited capacity of bikes it can hold.
* **Van**: takes broken bike from station, drops the broken bike to garage, takes fixed bike from garage, drops fixed bike to station, and has a limited capacity.
* **Garage**: accepts broken bikes from the van, fixes broken bike, returns fixed bike to van, and has a limited capacity.

###To-Do
* Implement Van class
* Implement Garage class

## What we learnt
* Introduced to CRC (Class-Responsibility-Collaboration) Card
* Started coding in Ruby
* Testing using Rspec
* Mocking using doubles in Rspec

* DRY Principle

## Technologies Used
* Ruby 2.1.2
* Rspec
* IRB

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Change into the directory
3. Run IRB
